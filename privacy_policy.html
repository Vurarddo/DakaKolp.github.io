        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to My Dictionary App. This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures on the collection,
            use, disclosure, and protection of your information when you use My Dictionary App. The app allows you to
            add custom dictionaries and words, and offers authentication via social networks like Google and Apple.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Provided Information</strong>: When you register through social network accounts (Google,

                You can also create and manage custom dictionaries and words within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Device and Usage Information</strong>: We collect information about how you use our app
                including the actions you take in your account (such as adding words, creating dictionaries), and data
                about your device (such as operating system).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <ul>

        <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third Parties</strong>: We may share your information with third-party service providers who
                assist us in operating the app, such as hosting and database management. Information shared with third
                parties is subject to their own privacy policies and practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Networks</strong>: If you choose to register or log in through social networks (Google,

        <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration,
            disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet-based service can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee
            absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your information in our possession. You can manage your

            After confirming the deletion, the account data will be completely removed and you won't be able to recover it.</p>

            Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
